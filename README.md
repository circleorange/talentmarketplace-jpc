# Design
- Application built using Jetpack Compose
- Application built on MVVM architecture
- Application uses bottom navigation bar

# Git Approach
- `main` branch used for stable releases
- `develop` branch is the default working branch
- `feature` branches created from `develop` branch and once ready, merged back to `develop` branch
- New features and bugs tracked using Github issues
- In most cases, `feature` branch would aim to close one or more issues
- Once `develop` branch contains suitable features, it is merged to `main` branch with release tag

# Personal Statement
Fun and a nightmare at the same time! I think if I had better knowledge of Jetpack Compose ahead of time, the application would have been planned much better.
Having whatever knowledge I have of Jetpack Compose, I would still prefer to go ahead with it instead of raw XML as it made the development experience more pleasurable and maybe even faster.
However, not having properly structured material meant I had to have over 50 new tabs open every day for the last couple of weeks, getting information from so many sources I wouldn't be able to count.
Overall, it was quite difficult and maybe just using raw XML would have made life easier, but at the same time I have learned a lot.
